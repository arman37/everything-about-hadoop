#### Quick Intro to Hadoop :
[
&nbsp;@ An open-source data processing framework <br />
&nbsp;@ written in Java <br />
&nbsp;@ is used to develop data processing applications which are executed in a distributed computing environment <br />
&nbsp;@ allows us to store and process big data in a distributed environment across clusters of cheap and widely available commodity computers using simple programming models <br />
&nbsp;@ data processing model is based on ‘Data Locality’ concept wherein computational logic is sent to cluster nodes(server) containing data <br />
&nbsp;@ such computational logic sent to cluster nodes is nothing but a compiled version of a program written in a high level language such as Java which processes data stored in HDFS <br />
&nbsp;@ designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage <br />
&nbsp;@ runs applications using the MapReduce algorithm, where the data is processed in parallel on different CPU nodes <br />
